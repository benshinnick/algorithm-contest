# Sorting Algorithm Contest

React application for visualizing sorting algorithms competing agianst each other in real time.

## Implemented Sorting Algorithms

* Merge
* Quick
* Heap
* Shell
* Insertion
* Selection

# Pathfinding Algorithm Contest
I am working on a separate page where pathfinding algorithms can compete to find a path the quickest on the same graph. Right now the mazes & maps buttons, the skip button, and the add contestant buttons do not work, but everything else is implemented. I am hoping to finish the project and optimize everything in the next few weeks.

## Implemented Pathfinding Algorithms

* Dijkstra
* A* Search
* Greedy Best-first Search
* Depth-first Search
* Breadth-first-search
