# Pathfinding Algorithm Contest
This project is still a work in progress. I am working on a separate page where pathfinding algorithms can compete to find a path the quickest on the same graph.
<br /><br />Here is a preview of what the project currently looks like after three Dijkstra algorithms finished competing against each other:
